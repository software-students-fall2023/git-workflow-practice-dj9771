# Article: How Observability Prevents Developers from Flying Blind

## What I find interesting about this article
In his article [How Observability Prevents Developers from Flying Blind](https://sdtimes.com/monitoring/how-observability-prevents-developers-from-flying-blind/), the author Katie Dee claims that "failing to provide developers with insight into their tools and processes could lead to unaddressed bugs and even system failures in the future," which is as dangerous as drivers encountering "an unforeseen, and ultimately avoidable, accident" because of their blind spots. I agree with the author that it's important for software engineers to receive feedback in every development iteration to improve observability so that they get to know where, when, and why a specific component doesn't meet clients' expectations. Furthermore, I believe the observability mentioned in the article heavily correlates to more productivity in an organization by making software engineers feel more secure. 

Relating the measure to improve observability introduced in this article with the process of software development taught in Software Engineering course, I discover that both of them can be considered practical implementation frameworks of the Agile manifesto. Events in every sprint such as backlog creation, sprint planning, daily scrum, backlog grooming, sprint review, stakeholder demo, and team retrospective also "prevent developers from flying blind".

Observability acts like a "black box" that pilots use, giving developers the data they need to understand their system's internal state at any point in time. Without observability, developers are essentially "flying blind," making it difficult to diagnose problems and affecting the reliability of applications. Therefore, investing in good observability practices and tools is essential for maintaining high-quality, reliable software.--Chang Liu
